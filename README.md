# Carpark Project
> Mark Belstead - 20145583

## Overview

In this assessment, you must design and implement a simplified car park system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The system will consist of a car park, sensors, and displays to track the cars entering and exiting and the availability of parking bays.

The system will be implemented in Python using the PyCharm IDE. You will use version control to manage your project and submit your work.

This guide provides detailed step-by-step instructions for completing the project. You do not have to use this guide, but it will make your life easier and ensure you meet all project requirements. If you choose not to follow the guide, read the submission requirements carefully (from your Blackboard Assessments tab) to ensure you meet all requirements.
